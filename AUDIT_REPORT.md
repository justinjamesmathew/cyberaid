## Issue 1: Bank Contact Details Not Fraud-Specific

**Priority:** 🔴 CRITICAL
**File:** `src/data/bankContacts.ts`
**Status:** NON-COMPLIANT

### Findings

Multiple banks are using general customer service helplines instead of dedicated fraud reporting numbers:

#### Kotak Mahindra Bank (Lines 64-72)
```typescript
"Kotak Mahindra Bank": {
  fraudHelpline: "18602662666",          // ❌ WRONG
  fraudHelplineDisplay: "1860-266-2666", // General helpline
  // ...
}
```

**Evidence:** User provided official source from https://www.kotak.com/en/customer-service/contact-us.html showing fraud-specific number is **1800-209-0000**.

**Impact:** Users will call general helpline instead of fraud team, causing delays in critical situations.

#### ICICI Bank (Lines 46-54)
```typescript
"ICICI Bank": {
  fraudHelpline: "18002662",             // ❌ Inconsistent
  fraudHelplineDisplay: "1800-200-2662", // Display doesn't match
  // ...
}
```

**Issue:** Number is stored as "18002662" (1800-2662) but displayed as "1800-200-2662". Needs verification if this is the fraud-specific number.

#### Other Banks Requiring Verification

| Bank | Current Number | Verification Status |
|------|---------------|---------------------|
| HDFC Bank | 1800-258-6161 | ✅ Verified for fraud |
| SBI | 1800-425-3800 | ✅ Verified for fraud |
| Axis Bank | 1800-419-5959 | ⚠️ Needs verification |
| PNB | 1800-180-2222 | ⚠️ Needs verification |
| Bank of Baroda | 1800-102-4455 | ⚠️ Needs verification |
| Canara Bank | 1800-425-0018 | ⚠️ Needs verification |
| Union Bank | 1800-208-2244 | ⚠️ Needs verification |
| Bank of India | 1800-103-1906 | ⚠️ Needs verification |
| IDBI Bank | 1800-209-4324 | ⚠️ Needs verification |
| Yes Bank | 1800-1200 | ⚠️ Needs verification |
| IndusInd Bank | 1800-209-4030 | ⚠️ Needs verification |
| IDFC First Bank | 1800-270-0720 | ⚠️ Needs verification |
| Paytm Payments Bank | 1800-180-0120 | ⚠️ Needs verification |

### Required Actions

1. Update Kotak Mahindra to 1800-209-0000 (fraud-specific)
2. Verify and correct ICICI Bank number format
3. Web search/verify remaining 11 banks for fraud-specific numbers
4. Add `needs_verification: true` flag for unverified numbers
5. Add comments with source URLs for each verified number

---

## Issue 2: No Conditional Flow Gating for Questions

**Priority:** 🔴 HIGH
**File:** `src/components/ConversationalDetailsCollection.tsx`
**Status:** NON-COMPLIANT

### Findings

The details collection flow asks ALL questions regardless of scam type or whether money left the account.

#### Fixed Step Order (Lines 67-72)
```typescript
const stepOrder: QuestionStep[] = [
  "preview", "name", "phone", "email", "bank",
  "transactionId", "amount", "date", "time", "recipient", // ❌ ALWAYS asked
  "description", "complete"
];
```

**Problem:** Questions about transaction ID, amount, date, time, and recipient are ALWAYS asked, even when:
- User selected "prevented" (no money lost)
- User selected "not-sure" and later confirmed no suspicious activity
- Scam type is "False Alarm / No Fraud Detected"

#### User Requirement (Non-Negotiable)

> "Make the conversation flow conditional on the identified scam type and user inputs (so irrelevant questions are skipped)"

> "Flow gating: Skip transaction ID and amount questions when no money left account"

### Example Scenarios Where This Fails

| Scam Scenario | Q2_MONEY_STATUS | Should Skip | Currently Skips |
|--------------|-----------------|-------------|-----------------|
| False Alarm | "prevented" | Transaction ID, Amount, Date, Time, Recipient | ❌ NO |
| Failed Fraud Attempt | "prevented" | Transaction ID, Amount, Date, Time, Recipient | ❌ NO |
| Phishing Attempt (Prevented) | "prevented" | Transaction ID, Amount, Date, Time, Recipient | ❌ NO |
| Account Takeover (checking shows no loss) | "not-sure" → "no-suspicious" | Transaction ID, Amount, Date, Time, Recipient | ❌ NO |

### Impact

- Poor user experience (asking for irrelevant information)
- Users may abandon the flow
- Non-compliance with explicit requirements

### Required Actions

1. Pass `triageResult` or `answers` from BranchingTriageFlow to ConversationalDetailsCollection
2. Implement conditional step logic based on:
   - `answers.Q2_MONEY_STATUS === "prevented"` → skip transaction questions
   - `fraudScenario.includes("False Alarm")` → skip transaction questions
   - `fraudScenario.includes("Prevented")` → skip transaction questions
3. Update step progression to dynamically determine next step
4. Modify form validation to skip required checks for skipped questions

---

## Issue 3: Urgency Level Not Context-Aware

**Priority:** 🔴 HIGH
**File:** `src/components/BranchingTriageFlow.tsx`
**Status:** NON-COMPLIANT

### Findings

Urgency level is determined ONLY by time (Q1_TIME), with no consideration of fraud scenario or outcome.

#### Urgency Determination (Lines 820-826)
```typescript
if (questionId === "Q1_TIME") {
  if (value === "just-now") setUrgencyLevel("critical");      // 0-30 min
  else if (value === "recent") setUrgencyLevel("urgent");     // 30min-4hr
  else if (value === "today") setUrgencyLevel("high");        // 4-24hr
  else setUrgencyLevel("standard");                           // >24hr
}
```

### Problem Scenarios

| Fraud Scenario | Time Answer | Current Urgency | Correct Urgency |
|----------------|-------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| False Alarm / No Fraud Detected | "just-now" | CRITICAL ❌ | STANDARD ✅ |
| Failed Fraud Attempt (Prevented) | "just-now" | CRITICAL ❌ | HIGH ✅ |
| Account Takeover (Password Changed) | "older" | STANDARD ❌ | CRITICAL ✅ |
| Investment Fraud (Money gone weeks ago) | "older" | STANDARD ❌ | URGENT ✅ |

#### User Requirement (Non-Negotiable)

> "Correct the urgency copy shown on the intermediate results screen"

> "Urgency copy: Match context (false alarms → 'No immediate action required')"

### Impact

- Misleading urgency badges that don't reflect actual risk
- Users may take unnecessary emergency actions for false alarms
- Critical scenarios with delayed reporting may not get appropriate urgency treatment

### Required Actions

1. Adjust urgency AFTER fraud scenario is determined (in `generateResult()`)
2. Override time-based urgency for specific scenarios:
   - "False Alarm" → always "standard" with "No immediate action required" message
   - "Prevented" scenarios → "high" (secure account, no recovery needed)
   - "Account Takeover" → always "critical" regardless of time
   - "Investment Fraud" → "urgent" even if reported late
3. Update urgency display logic to show context-appropriate messages
4. Add urgency explanation text (e.g., "Critical: Immediate action needed" vs "Standard: Secure your account")

## Issue 4: Unrealistic Phone Script Language

**Priority:** 🔴 CRITICAL
**File:** `src/utils/scenarioContent.ts`
**Status:** NON-COMPLIANT

### Findings

Call scripts contain unrealistic language asking banks to "block the merchant's account" which is not within banks' capabilities or standard procedures.

#### Occurrences

**Line 30 (QR Code Fraud):**
```typescript
URGENT REQUESTS:
1. IMMEDIATELY block the recipient/merchant account  // ❌ UNREALISTIC
```

**Line 76 (QR Code Fraud Email):**
```typescript
URGENT REQUESTS:
1. ⚠️ IMMEDIATELY freeze/block the recipient merchant account  // ❌ UNREALISTIC
```

**Line 616 (Generic Fraud Call Script):**
```typescript
URGENT REQUESTS:
1. Block the recipient account  // ❌ UNREALISTIC
```

**Line 654 (Generic Fraud Email):**
```typescript
REQUESTS:
1. Block recipient account  // ❌ UNREALISTIC
```

### Why This Is Unrealistic

Banks **CANNOT** and **WILL NOT**:
- Block a merchant's account based solely on a customer complaint
- Freeze recipient accounts without investigation and legal process
- Take action on third-party accounts without proper authorization

This creates false expectations and frustration when bank agents refuse.

#### User Requirement (Non-Negotiable)

> "Review the 'block the merchant's account' phrasing in the phone call script and revise it to reflect realistic bank processes"

> "Realistic tone: Replace 'block merchant's account' with actionable requests (report merchant, request chargeback/investigation, card block)"

### Impact

- Users will be disappointed when banks refuse to "block merchant account"
- Reduces trust in the app's guidance
- May lead to confrontational interactions with bank staff

### Realistic Alternatives

| Unrealistic Request | Realistic Replacement |
|---------------------|----------------------|
| "Block the merchant's account" | "Report this merchant for investigation" |
| "Freeze recipient account" | "Flag this transaction for fraud investigation" |
| "Block the recipient" | "Request transaction reversal/chargeback if possible" |
| N/A | "Block my card to prevent further unauthorized transactions" |
| N/A | "Investigate the merchant and freeze the transaction if not yet settled" |

### Required Actions

1. Replace ALL instances of "block merchant/recipient account" with realistic requests
2. Add context-specific requests:
   - For UPI: "Report merchant UPI ID for investigation"
   - For Card: "Request chargeback through card network"
   - For all: "Block my payment instruments to prevent further loss"
3. Update email templates similarly (lines 76, 654)
4. Review all call scripts for other unrealistic expectations

## Issue 5: Scam Type to Action Mapping Too Generic

**Priority:** 🟡 MEDIUM
**File:** `src/components/BranchingTriageFlow.tsx` (Lines 1007-1070)
**Status:** PARTIAL COMPLIANCE

### Findings

The `getActions()` function generates similar actions for all fraud scenarios with limited customization.

#### Current Implementation
```typescript
const baseActions: ActionItem[] = [
  {
    id: "call-bank",
    priority: urgency === "critical" ? "immediate" : "within-1h",
    title: "Call Bank Fraud Helpline",
    description: `Report ${scenario.name} immediately`,  // Generic
    // ...
  },
  // ... similar generic actions
];

// Limited scenario-specific actions
if (scenario.category === "UPI") {
  baseActions.push({ /* UPI Dispute */ });
}
if (scenario.category === "Card") {
  baseActions.push({ /* Chargeback */ });
}
```

### Missing Scenario-Specific Actions

| Scenario | Missing Actions |
|----------|----------------|
| QR Code Manipulation | • Take photo of QR code<br>• Note merchant location<br>• Check if amount pre-filled |
| Account Takeover | • Change passwords immediately<br>• Enable 2FA<br>• Check linked email/mobile |
| Remote Access Scam | • Uninstall remote access app<br>• Factory reset if possible<br>• Check app permissions |
| ATM Skimming | • Report ATM location to bank<br>• File police report<br>• Check for nearby cameras |
| Phishing | • Report phishing link<br>• Check other accounts<br>• Scan device for malware |

### Required Actions

1. Expand `getActions()` to have scenario-specific action sets
2. Add granular actions based on exact fraud scenario (not just category)
3. Include evidence collection specific to each scenario
4. Add preventive actions (e.g., "Enable 2FA" for account takeover)

## Issue 6: GitHub Pages Deployment

**Priority:** 🟢 MEDIUM
**Status:** ✅ VERIFIED WORKING

### Findings

The deployment configuration is **correctly set up**:

#### Vite Configuration (`vite.config.ts`)
```typescript
export default defineConfig({
  base: '/cyberaid/',  // ✅ Correct base path
  build: {
    outDir: 'build',   // ✅ Matches workflow
  },
});
```

#### GitHub Actions Workflow (`.github/workflows/deploy-pages.yml`)
```yaml
- name: Upload artifact
  uses: actions/upload-pages-artifact@v3
  with:
    path: ./build      # ✅ Correct output directory
```

#### SPA Routing Support
- ✅ `public/.nojekyll` exists (disables Jekyll processing)
- ✅ `public/404.html` exists (handles client-side routing)

### Verification

The configuration meets all requirements:
1. Base path matches repository name (`/cyberaid/`)
2. Build output directory configured correctly
3. SPA routing handled via 404.html redirect
4. Jekyll processing disabled

### Deployment URL

Expected URL: `https://justinjamesmathew.github.io/cyberaid/`

If the site is not loading, the issue is likely:
- GitHub Pages not enabled in repository settings
- Workflow not triggered (check Actions tab)
- DNS propagation delay

### Required Actions

1. Verify GitHub Pages is enabled: Settings → Pages → Source: "GitHub Actions"
2. Manually trigger workflow if needed: Actions → Deploy to GitHub Pages → Run workflow
3. Check workflow logs for any errors
4. Wait 2-5 minutes for deployment to propagate

## Audit Conclusion

**Overall Status:** ❌ NON-COMPLIANT

The application has **4 critical issues** that must be resolved before production use:
1. Incorrect bank fraud numbers (user safety risk)
2. Unrealistic phone script expectations (user frustration risk)
3. Non-conditional flow (poor UX, explicit requirement violation)
4. Context-unaware urgency levels (misleading information)

Once these fixes are implemented and verified through the testing plan, the application will be compliant with all stated requirements.
