## 🎯 How the Branching Works

### **Adaptive Question Flow:**

```
Q1: When did this happen?
     ↓
Q2: Has money left your account?
     ↓
   ┌─────┬─────┬─────┐
   │     │     │     │
 LOSS  PREVENTED  CHECK
   │     │       │
   ↓     ↓       ↓
[Different questions based on path]
```

### **Example Path: UPI QR Code Scam**

```
User answers:
1. "Just now" → Sets urgency to CRITICAL
2. "Yes, money is gone" → Routes to LOSS PATH
3. "UPI payment" → Routes to UPI BRANCH
4. "Scanning QR code" → Narrows to QR scenarios
5. "Wrong amount deducted" → ENDPOINT: "QR Amount Manipulation"

Result:
- Fraud Scenario: "UPI QR Code Amount Manipulation"
- Urgency: CRITICAL
- Recovery Probability: 75%
- Custom Action Plan with 6-8 specific actions
```
