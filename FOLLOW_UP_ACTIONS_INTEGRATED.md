## üîß Technical Implementation

### State Management
- Local state with React hooks (`useState`)
- Expand/collapse state per card
- Completion tracking per card
- Data state for each card (reference numbers, evidence items, email status)

### Key Features Implemented

**Expandable Cards:**
```tsx
const [expanded, setExpanded] = useState({
  upiDispute: false,
  evidence: false,
  emailBank: false
});
```

**Step Navigation (UPI Dispute):**
```tsx
const [currentStep, setCurrentStep] = useState(1);
const progressPercentage = (currentStep / totalSteps) * 100;
```

**File Upload Handling:**
```tsx
const handleFiles = (files: File[]) => {
  const validFiles = files.filter(file => file.size <= maxSize);
  if (validFiles.length > 0) {
    onUpload(validFiles);
  }
};
```

**Email Generation:**
```tsx
const generateEmailTemplate = (details: any) => {
  return `Dear ${details.bank} Fraud Team,...`;
};
```

### Deep Linking
```tsx
const deepLinks: Record<string, string> = {
  phonepe: "phonepe://",
  googlepay: "googlepay://",
  paytm: "paytm://"
};
```

### Clipboard Integration
```tsx
navigator.clipboard.writeText(text);
```

### Mailto Links
```tsx
const mailto = `mailto:${toEmail}?subject=${encodeURIComponent(subject)}&body=${encodeURIComponent(emailBody)}`;
window.location.href = mailto;
```

   - Test navigation, file upload, email copy
   - Mark actions as completed

3. **Expected Behavior:**
   - Smooth expand/collapse animations
   - All buttons respond to clicks
   - Copy functionality works
   - Deep links attempt to open apps

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Current Limitations (Mock Data)

The following features use placeholder/mock functionality:

### 1. **File Upload**

- No ZIP/PDF generation
- No cloud upload

**To Implement:**
- Client-side ZIP generation (JSZip)
- PDF generation (jsPDF, react-pdf)
- Cloud storage integration (Google Drive API)

### 4. **Deep Linking**
- Deep links may not work on desktop
- Requires UPI apps installed on mobile

**To Implement:**
- Fallback handling for desktop
- App detection logic

### 5. **Data Persistence**
- All data lost on page refresh
- No localStorage or backend storage

**To Implement:**
- localStorage for client-side persistence
- Backend API with database
