# Conversational Triage Flow - Complete Guide

**Date:** October 15, 2025
**Status:** ✅ Implemented and Running

---

## 🎯 Why Triage?

### The Problem with "Emergency Button"
The old single-button approach had issues:
- ❌ No urgency assessment
- ❌ Couldn't personalize actions
- ❌ Users wasted time in wrong flow
- ❌ All cases treated equally

### The Triage Solution
A **conversational assessment** that:
- ✅ Assesses urgency (critical <30min vs. older)
- ✅ **Deduces fraud type from symptoms** (not asking directly!)
- ✅ Routes to right actions immediately
- ✅ Personalizes the entire action plan
- ✅ Explains WHY each question is asked

---

## 🗣️ Conversational Design Philosophy

### Key Principles

**1. Symptom-Based, Not Technical**
```
❌ Bad: "What type of fraud?" (confusing)
✅ Good: "What were you trying to do?" (relatable)
```

**2. One Question at a Time**
- Clean, focused UI
- Smooth animations between questions
- Progress indicator shows journey

**3. Transparency**
- Each question explains WHY it's needed
- Users understand the value of answering

**4. Smart Deduction**
- App deduces fraud type from answers
- No need for user to know technical terms

---

## 📋 The 5-Question Flow

### Question 1: Time Assessment ⏱️

**Purpose:** Determine urgency level for routing

**Why We Ask:**
> "This helps us prioritize urgent actions to maximize recovery chances"

**Options:**
1. 🔥 **Just now (< 30 mins)** → `urgencyLevel: "critical"`
   - Routes straight to action dashboard
   - Skips detail collection
   - Focuses on IMMEDIATE freeze/block actions

2. ⚡ **Within last 4 hours** → `urgencyLevel: "urgent"`
   - Still in golden window
   - Shows countdown timer
   - Prioritizes bank call + cybercrime

3. ⚠️ **Today (4-24 hours ago)** → `urgencyLevel: "high"`
   - Goes through full detail collection
   - More time for evidence gathering

4. 📅 **Yesterday or earlier** → `urgencyLevel: "medium"`
   - Different workflow (documentation-focused)
   - Emphasis on dispute process

---

### Question 2: Context 🤔

**Purpose:** Understand the situation/activity

**Why We Ask:**
> "This helps us understand the situation and context"

**Options:**
1. 🏪 **Shopping/paying at a store**
   - Likely: QR code scam, card skimming

2. 🛒 **Online shopping/payment**
   - Likely: E-commerce fraud, fake websites

3. 📞 **Received a call/SMS/email**
   - Likely: Phishing, impersonation

4. 📱 **Installing an app**
   - Likely: Malicious app, trojan

5. 💸 **Transferring money to someone**
   - Likely: Payment fraud, romance scam

6. ❓ **Something else**
   - Catch-all option

---

### Question 3: Payment Method 💳

**Purpose:** Identify which accounts to secure

**Why We Ask:**
> "This identifies which accounts need to be secured immediately"

**Options:**
1. 📱 **UPI (PhonePe/GPay/Paytm)**
   - Action: File UPI dispute, contact NPCI

2. 💳 **Debit or Credit card**
   - Action: Block card, dispute transaction

3. 🌐 **Net banking**
   - Action: Change password, freeze account

4. 🔐 **I shared OTP/PIN/password**
   - Action: URGENT password reset, 2FA enable

5. 🏧 **Money withdrawn from ATM**
   - Action: Report card cloning, check for skimmer

6. ✋ **No payment yet - I stopped it**
   - Action: Preventive measures, education

**Smart Combination Detection:**
```typescript
// Example fraud type deduction:
Context: Shopping at store
+ Payment: UPI
+ Issue: Wrong amount
= "UPI QR Code Manipulation"
```

---

### Question 4: What Went Wrong ⚠️

**Purpose:** Identify exact fraud pattern

**Why We Ask:**
> "This helps identify the exact fraud type and appropriate actions"

**Options:**
1. 💰 **Wrong amount was deducted**
   - Fraud Type: Amount manipulation, QR code scam

2. 🔄 **Multiple unauthorized transactions**
   - Fraud Type: Account takeover, card cloning

3. 😰 **Shared OTP/PIN (regret it now)**
   - Fraud Type: Phishing + social engineering

4. 🔒 **Account locked or accessed**
   - Fraud Type: Account takeover

5. 📦 **Paid but no product/refund**
   - Fraud Type: E-commerce fraud

6. 🎣 **Link/app asked for bank details**
   - Fraud Type: Phishing (link-based)

7. ⚠️ **Pressured/threatened to pay**
   - Fraud Type: Extortion

---

### Question 5: Final Details 🏦

**Purpose:** Generate personalized action plan

**Why We Ask:**
> "We need these to generate the right complaint forms, contact information, and prioritized actions"

**Inputs:**
1. **Bank Selection** (dropdown)
   - Pre-loaded with 13 major banks
   - Determines fraud helpline number
   - Auto-fills email addresses

2. **Amount** (number input)
   - Can be ₹0 if prevented
   - Determines high-value procedures
   - Used in all complaint forms

**Privacy Notice:**
> 🔒 "All information is processed locally and encrypted. We never share your data with third parties."

## 🧠 Smart Fraud Type Deduction

### Deduction Logic Matrix

| Context | Payment | Issue | → Deduced Type |
|---------|---------|-------|----------------|
| Store | UPI | Wrong amount | UPI QR Code Manipulation |
| Call/SMS | Shared OTP | Account access | Phishing + Account Takeover |
| Online | Card | Multiple txn | Card Cloning / Data Breach |
| Transfer | UPI | No product | Payment Fraud |
| Any | Any | Forced payment | Extortion |
| App download | Any | Unauthorized txn | Malicious App / Trojan |

### Code Implementation

```typescript
const deduceFraudType = (answers: Partial<TriageData>): string => {
  const { context, paymentMethod, issue } = answers;

  // Specific pattern matching
  if (context === "shopping-store" &&
      paymentMethod === "upi" &&
      issue === "wrong-amount") {
    return "UPI QR Code Manipulation";
  }

  if (context === "received-communication" &&
      issue === "shared-regret") {
    return "Phishing + Social Engineering";
  }

  // Fallback to generic based on payment method
  if (paymentMethod === "upi") return "UPI Fraud";
  if (paymentMethod === "card") return "Card Fraud";

  return "Financial Fraud";
};
```

## 📊 Recommended Actions Generation

  // Critical/Urgent → Immediate call
  if (urgencyLevel === "critical" || urgencyLevel === "urgent") {
    actions.push("call-bank-immediately");
  }

  // Unauthorized access → Freeze
  if (issue === "account-access" || issue === "multiple-txn") {
    actions.push("freeze-account");
  }

  // UPI specific
  if (paymentMethod === "upi") {
    actions.push("file-upi-dispute");
    actions.push("report-to-npci");
